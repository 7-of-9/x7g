MECH1.COB
---------

I have been trying to think of a worthwhile project to work on in
trueSpace 2. I saw some models at a friends house of Battle Mechs 
and I decided that these would look cool in trueSpace, so I 
borrowed them. This is the first MECH of two (the other I am 
still working on). Hope they are of use to someone...

Remember ... trueSpace rules!

Look out for trueSpace 3 coming soon!
