     Space Craft from Star Wars Trilogy, original design by John Dykstra
     and others (I'm not sure).
     This document contains some information about following files.

DEATHS.ZIP  : Death Star #1  with 200 frame animation
              Death Star Trench Run animation with X-Wing and Tie Interceptor.
              (I know, TIE Interceptor didn't exist in Episode IV, you
              may replace it with TIE Fighter or Darth Vader's TIE Fighter)
              from Episode IV (1977)

TIE-F-.ZIP  : TIE Fighter of the Imperial Force
              ( Vertices : 1784, Faces : 3135 )
              from Episode IV (1977)

TIE-DV.ZIP  : Darth Vader's TIE Fighter (a.k.a. Prototype TIE Interceptor)
              ( Vertices : 1502, Faces : 2743 )
              from Episode IV (1977)

TIE-I-.ZIP  : TIE Interceptor of the Imperial Force
              ( Vertices : 2309, Faces : 3991 )
              from Episode V (1980)

TIE-B-.ZIP  : TIE Bomber of the Imperial Force
              ( Vertices : 1904, Faces : 3531 )
              from Episode V (1980)

AT-AT-.ZIP  : All-Terrain Armored-Transport with 400 frame animation.
              AT-AT walks for a while and blast everything in its way. 
              sorry, AT-AT model is not as detailed as TIE's, I do not 
              have good picture of it, and have hard time finding good 
              pictures any where.
              from Episode V (1980)

     These are Project files.  Move any .TGA or .JPG files to your maps
  directory and load the .PRJ files.  I prefer .PRJ files because they  
  preserve unit setup.  Render at 640 x 300 resolution, the background 
  picture is in 640 x 300 resolution.

     The meshes got most of my attention, so the mapping, materials, and
  lightings are not as good as they should be.  You are responsible for 
  supplying them if you are not satisfied with mine.    
  
     Unlike the other TIE Fighter models out there, mines are created using 
  3D-Studio 3.0.  So All the invisible lines are invisible as they should be.  
  All the animations are done using 3D-Sudio 3.0.  The meshes are based on
  several books and magazine articles, I have found some discrepancies between
  different sources concerning the dimensions of the vehicles.  I used the
  dimensions that made most sense to me.
  
     For faster rendering, I have created the meshes in such way that you 
  have to render with Forced 2 Sided option on, to get correct images.
  Also don't forget to set the units to metrics ( It is already been set to
  metrics if .prj file is used ), because all the meshes are done in 
  metrics and Yes, they are in scale.  If you find any discrepancies or 
  deviations from documents you may have, just let me know, I will fix 
  meshes as soon as possible.

Caution: For Death Star Project,
  Death Star has diameter of 120,000 meters while the TIE's are about 
  6 meters in length, so don't get lost!

  I am still working on X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing, B-Wing, AT-ST, Imperial Star
  Destroyer, Imperial Shuttle Tyderium, Millennium Falcon, Rebel Frigate, 
  Rebel Corvette (a.k.a. Blockade runner), Darth Vader's Star Destroyer and 
  Death Star II (with its Docking Bay).

  Also several .FLC's and .MPG's are available.
